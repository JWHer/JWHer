# 👋 Hi, I’m Jeongwon Her (@JWHer)

- 🧑‍💻 AI/ML Engineer  
- 🚀 I love building scalable AI solutions — from model development and deployment, to cloud-native MLOps and real-world applications.
- 🏗️ Recently worked on:
  - Edge-based LLM IoT Control Solutions (scenario code generation, edge inference)
  - Private GPU Cloud & MLOps platform (Kubernetes, ArgoCD, MLflow, CI/CD, monitoring)
  - Large-scale Semi-Supervised Data Collection and Continuous Learning Pipelines (Airflow, Postgres/MongoDB, loss-based filtering)
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring efficient model deployment on resource-constrained devices, and continuous learning in production environments.
